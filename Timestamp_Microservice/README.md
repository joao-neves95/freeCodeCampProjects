API Basejump: [Timestamp Microservice Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice)
=========================

User stories:

  1) I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)

  2) If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

  3) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
